# assignment_1_Dr-Strange-v-s-COVID-19


in this problem i used Bellman-Ford algorithm.
m lines follow, i

th line contains three integers, universe ai and bi, connected through the i
th portal

and ci, the travelling time between the mentioned universes.
Then n lines follow, ith line contains ki, number of time instances when the demons are patrolling the
i
th universe. Then ki space separated integers tij follow in sorted order. so  It starts with a starting vertex and calculates the distances of other vertices which can be reached by one edge. It then continues to find a path with two edges and so on.
